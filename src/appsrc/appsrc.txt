    Park It! Live Data PHP Script

    This PHP script reads the last line of data from the "appsrc/data.txt" file and echoes it.

    system is offline and live data is not available.

    Usage: This script is typically included in an HTML file to dynamically display live data on a web page.

    Dependencies: This script depends on the existence and readability of the "appsrc/data.txt" file.
